# CLAUDE.md - CubicLog Development Guide

## Project Overview

CubicLog is a **SIMPLE** self-hosted logging solution by Mendex that provides structured logging with a clean separation between headers (structured) and body (freestyle JSON). 

**✅ COMPLETED PROJECT** - This is the final implementation guide reflecting what was actually built.

## Implementation Status

🎉 **CubicLog is COMPLETE and PRODUCTION READY!**

✅ **Core Features Implemented:**
- Single binary deployment (3 files: main.go, web.go, main_test.go)
- SQLite database with automatic table creation
- Beautiful web UI with Alpine.js v3 and Tailwind CSS v4
- Full Tailwind CSS color palette support (21 colors)
- Real-time dashboard with auto-refresh
- Advanced search and filtering
- CSV/JSON export functionality
- Statistics endpoint
- API key authentication
- Automatic log retention and cleanup
- CLI flags support
- Cross-platform GitHub Actions releases
- Professional homepage with GitHub releases integration
- Comprehensive documentation

## Project Philosophy

Radical simplicity achieved through **Developer-AI collaboration**. Single binary, SQLite database, no build process. If it needs Kubernetes, we've failed.

## Philosophy on Web UI

The web UI should be **beautiful and functional**, not primitive. Using CDN-hosted Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS is perfectly fine - these don't add complexity to deployment (no build process, no npm). The key is that everything remains in a single embedded HTML string that's served by the Go binary.

Good: Alpine.js + Tailwind from CDN embedded in Go
Bad: React with webpack build process
Good: Professional, modern interface
Bad: Ugly monospace tables from 1995

## Core Principles

1. **Single binary** - Download and run
2. **SQLite only** - No external database
3. **No build process** - Go binary + embedded HTML
4. **5-minute setup** - Must be running in 5 minutes
5. **Zero configuration** - Works with defaults

## Actual Implementation Achieved

## Development Process (Completed)

### How CubicLog Was Built

**✅ Developer-AI Collaboration Process:**
1. **Vision & Architecture** - Human author defined requirements and philosophy
2. **Incremental Development** - Claude Code implemented features step by step
3. **Continuous Refinement** - Human guided and refined each iteration
4. **Quality Assurance** - Code review and testing at each step
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive docs in English throughout

**✅ Development Timeline:**
1. Initial implementation (core server + basic UI)
2. Simplification phase (reduced complexity per CLAUDE.md philosophy)
3. Enhancement phase (full Tailwind colors, advanced features)
4. Documentation phase (README, landing page)
5. Release automation (GitHub Actions)
6. Final documentation (English comments, Developer-AI acknowledgment)

### Adding Features Pattern

```bash
# Always keep it simple
claude-code "Add [FEATURE] to CubicLog in the simplest way possible"

# Test manually first
go run main.go
# Test the feature

# Only add tests if needed
claude-code "Add test for [FEATURE]"
```

## Common Patterns

### Adding Configuration

```bash
claude-code "Add env var configuration to CubicLog:
- PORT (default 8080)
- DB_PATH (default ./logs.db)
- API_KEY (optional)
- RETENTION_DAYS (default 30)
Keep defaults that work without any env vars"
```

### Client SDKs

```bash
claude-code "Create simple Go client for CubicLog:
- Single file client.go
- Methods: SendLog, GetLogs, Search
- No external dependencies
- Include usage example"
```

### Backup/Restore

```bash
claude-code "Add backup command to CubicLog:
- cubiclog --backup outputs SQLite dump to stdout
- cubiclog --restore reads SQLite dump from stdin
- Keep it simple with standard SQLite tools"
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude Code Makes It Complex

```bash
# Stop and restart simpler
claude-code "Simplify this to the bare minimum that works"
claude-code "Remove all unnecessary abstractions"
claude-code "Make this work in a single file"
```

### Getting Explanations

```bash
claude-code "Explain how SQLite FTS5 works in simple terms"
claude-code "What's the simplest way to add [FEATURE]?"
```

## Best Practices for Claude Code

### 1. Start Simple

Always create the simplest version first. You can refactor later if needed.

### 2. Avoid Premature Abstraction

```bash
# Bad - Too abstract too early
claude-code "Create repository pattern with interfaces"

# Good - Just make it work
claude-code "Add function to save log to SQLite"
```

### 3. Incremental Improvements

```bash
# Build incrementally
claude-code "Create basic HTTP server"
claude-code "Add log endpoint"
claude-code "Add SQLite storage"
claude-code "Add search"
claude-code "Add beautiful web UI"
```

### 4. Explicit Constraints

```bash
# Always specify simplicity
claude-code "Add [FEATURE] in the simplest way possible, single file if possible"
```

## File Structure (When you need it)

Start with single file, only split when it gets messy:

```
cubiclog/
├── main.go           # Start here, maybe stay here
├── logs.db           # Created automatically
├── README.md         # Brief usage instructions
```

If you need structure later:

```
cubiclog/
├── cmd/
│   └── cubiclog/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/
│   ├── log.go        # Log types and logic
│   ├── storage.go    # SQLite stuff
│   └── server.go     # HTTP handlers with embedded UI
└── README.md
```

## Quick Start (The ONLY commands you need)

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone github.com/mendexio/CubicLog
cd CubicLog
go run main.go

# Or build and run
go build -o cubiclog
./cubiclog

# Visit http://localhost:8080
# You're done. Seriously.
```

## The Mendex Way (Proven by CubicLog)

CubicLog successfully demonstrates the Mendex philosophy:

✅ **Build simple tools that work** - Single binary, SQLite, zero config
✅ **Respect developer time** - 5-minute setup, no complexity
✅ **Avoid complexity theater** - No Kubernetes, microservices, or build processes
✅ **Ship working software** - Production-ready from day one
✅ **Make it beautiful** - Professional UI proves simple ≠ ugly
✅ **Developer-AI collaboration** - Efficient development without sacrificing quality
